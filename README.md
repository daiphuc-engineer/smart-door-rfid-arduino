# Smart Door RFID using Arduino

## Overview
This project is a basic RFID-based access control system.
The system allows authorized RFID cards to unlock a door using a servo motor.

## Components
- Arduino UNO 3
- MFRC522 RFID module
- Servo motor
- GREEN LED, RED LED
- Buzzer
 
## Function Description
- Read RFID card UID
- Compare UID with authorized list
- Control servo motor to lock/unlock
- Use LED to indicate access status

## What I Learned
- Basic Arduino programming
- RFID module communication
- Servo motor control
- Simple system logic and debugging

## Future Improvements
- Add keypad or password
- Store UID in EEPROM
- Add buzzer or LCD display
